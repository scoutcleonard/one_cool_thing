```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)

library(tidyverse)
library(pins)
```

```{r}
meds_2022 <- tribble(
  ~name, ~shoes,
  "Desik", "sandals",
  "Connor", "flipflops",
  "Dan", "indoors",
  "Paloma", "tennies"
)
```


```{r}
awesome_board <- board_local()
```

Now we want to add our data to the pinned board so that I can access it, or others who have access to the directory can access. 

```{r}
awesome_board %>% 
  pin_write(meds_2022, "meds_2022", version = TRUE)
```

Once something is added to a pin, you can use pins to call in things. 

```{r}
awesome_board %>% 
  pin_read("meds_2022")
```

If you are creatinga  shared package for a team that uses reusable datasets, this means people don't have to download csvs, but they can exist as an R data object. 
```{r}
awesome_board %>% 
  pin_read("meds_2022", version = "20220525T231206Z-8fa95")
```
